####Sharding (Horizontal Scaling)####

<blockquote>Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with
very large data sets and high throughput operations.
There are two methods for addressing system growth : vertical scaling (capicity of single server) and horizontal scaling (dividing resource). MongoDB supports <em>horizontal scaling</em> through sharding.
