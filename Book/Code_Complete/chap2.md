**Letter Writing Metaphor** : primitive metaphor grows out of expression "write 
code" - the writing metaphor : developing program is like writing casual letters 
-- you sit down with pen, paper and ink then write it from start to finish.

     _ For an individual work or small scale project, the writing metaphor work 
     adequately, but for other purposes it leaves the party too early - it 
     does not describe software development fully or adequately.

     Writing is usually a one-person activity, whereas software project 
     development will most likely involve many peoples with many      
     different responsibilities.

     Writing has not "changing" phase after finish, but as much as 90% 
     development effort comes after its first release.

     In software construction, trying to create original work is often less 
     effect than focusing on the reuse of code, test case, design from previous 
     projects. _

Software Farming Development - **System Accretion Metaphor** : in incremental 
development, you first make the simplest possible of the system that will run. 
It does not have to accept realistic input, it does not have to implement 
realistic manipulation on datas, it also does not have to product realistic datas.
    
    _ It just has strong skeleton to hold the real system as it is developed
    This basic design like the oyster`s beginning a pearl with a small grain of 
    sand. _
