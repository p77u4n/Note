**Letter Writing Metaphor** : primitive metaphor grows out of expression "write 
code" - the writing metaphor : developing program is like writing casual letters 
-- you sit down with pen, paper and ink then write it from start to finish.
    
    1. For an individual work or small scale project, the writing metaphor work adequately, but for other purposes _it leaves the party too early_, it does not describe software development fully or adequately

    2. Writing is usually a one-person activity, whereas software project development will most likely involve many peoples with many different responsibilities.

    3. Writing has not "changing" phase after finish, but as much as 90% development effort comes after its first release.

    4. In software construction, trying to create original work is often less effect than focusing on the reuse of code, test case, design from previous projects. 

Software Farming Development - **System Accretion Metaphor** : in incremental 
development, you first make the simplest possible of the system that will run. 
It does not have to accept realistic input, it does not have to implement 
realistic manipulation on datas, it also does not have to product realistic datas.

    1. It just has _strong skeleton_ to hold the real system as it is developed This basic design like the oyster`s beginning a pearl with a small grain of sand.
