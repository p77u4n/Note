**Letter Writing Metaphor** : primitive metaphor grows out of expression "write 
code" - the writing metaphor : developing program is like writing casual letters 
-- you sit down with pen, paper and ink then write it from start to finish.
    
 1. For an individual work or small scale project, the writing metaphor work 
 adequately, but for other purposes _it leaves the party too early_, it 
 does not describe software development fully or adequately

 2. Writing is usually a one-person activity, whereas software project 
 development will most likely involve many peoples with many      
 different responsibilities.

 3. Writing has not "changing" phase after finish, but as much as 90% 
 development effort comes after its first release.

 4. In software construction, trying to create original work is often less 
 effect than focusing on the reuse of code, test case, design from previous 
 projects. 

Software Farming Development - **System Accretion Metaphor** : in incremental 
development, you first make the simplest possible of the system that will run. 
It does not have to accept realistic input, it does not have to implement 
realistic manipulation on datas, it also does not have to product realistic datas.

 1. It just has _strong skeleton_ to hold the real system as it is developed
 This basic design like the oyster`s beginning a pearl with a small grain of 
 sand.

*Software Construction : Building Software* : The image of _building software_
is useful than that of _writing software_ or _growing software.
 
 1. It is compatible with the idea of _software accretion_ and provides more 
 detailed guidance.

 2. Bulding a four-foot tower require a steady hand, a leveled surface, and 100
 undamaged beer cans. Bulding a tower 100 times of that side doesnt not merely
 require 100 times as many beer cans. It requires different kind of planning &
 construction together.
  + Designing for house - Sotfware Design : You have to make the design as good
  as possible
  + Reusing some gadget that already built : Using prebuilt libraries ...
  + Customizing : If you are building a first-class software product, you migh
  build your own some stuff that must be involved in your software sys to make 
  your software sys more fancy and perfectly look and feel.
 3. Both building construction and software construct benefit from appropriate 
 levels of planning.
  + Careful planning doesnt neccessarily mean exhaustive planning or over-
  planning.
  + A well-planned project improves your ability to change your mind later about
  details - The more exprience you have with the kind of sotfware you are build
  ing, the more details you can take for granted.
  + Making structural changes in program cost more that adding or deleting 
  peripheral features.

 4. The building-construction metaphor could be extended in a variety of other
 directions which is why the metatphor is so powerful.
  + Many terms common in software development derive from the building metaphor:
  software architecture, scaffoldingm construction, foundation classes and tearing
  code apart.

*The Intellectual Toolbox*
 1. People who are effective at developing high-quality software have spent years
 accumulating dozens of techniques.
  + The techniques are not reles but analytical tools.
  + A good craftsman knows the right tool for the job and knows how to use it 
  correctly.
  + The toolbox metaphor helps to keep all the methods, techniques, and tips in
  perspective-ready for use when appropriate.
